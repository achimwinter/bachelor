	abstract = {The Signal protocol is a cryptographic messaging protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for instant messaging in {WhatsApp}, Wire, and Facebook Messenger among many others, serving well over 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as “future secrecy” or “post-compromise security”), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent.},
